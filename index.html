        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
          This is a map of every property that is owned by a landlord. I have
          defined a landlord as someone who owns more than 1 property or has LLC
          or Trust in the name of the owner. This map should help illustrate how
          much property in Denver is owned as "an investment".

        <h3>How to use</h3>
        <p>
          Click on a marker to view the address, owner name, and the other
          properties that person owns.

        <h3>How can I verify this information?</h3>
        <p>
          All of this information is publicly available and verifiable at
          <a href="https://www.denvergov.org/property/realproperty/"
            >https://www.denvergov.org/property/realproperty/</a

        <h3>Things of Note</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Since this list is compiled by owner, there are owners that some
            people may not typically consider landlords. Owners like the "CITY &
            COUNTY OF DENVER" or "SCHOOL DISTRICT NO 1". I left those in the
            data set because I didn't want to accidentally remove one that
            sounds like it is a government entity when really it is a private
            entity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Government entities are marked using a red circle. Currently that
            only includes the "CITY & COUNTY OF DENVER" and "UNITED STATES OF
            AMERICA" but more can be added to that list if necessary
          </li>

        <h3>Mile High View</h3>
        <p>
          02/18/2021: After a first pass it appears that between 25% - 33% of
          home on any given block in Denver are rentals. Which would mean that 1
          out of every 3 or 4 Denverites are renters
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Why did you make this?</h3>
        <p>
          While living and working in Denver my partner and I have finally
          decided we would like to buy a house. We have been renting until we
          had enough money saved up. My partner had heard that we would be
          competing against investors and landlords. I was interested in
          learning how many properties in Denver were in fact owned by investors
          and landlords so I figured this would be a neat project. Little did I
          know how pervasive investor and landlord owned properties were.
