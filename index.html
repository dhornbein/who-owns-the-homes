      <h1>What is this?</h1>
      <p>
        This is a map of every property that is owned by a landlord. I have
        defined a landlord as someone who owns more than 1 property or has LLC
        or Trust in the name of the owner. This map should help illustrate how
        much property in Denver is owned as "an investment".
      </p>
      <h3>How to use</h3>
      <p>
        Click on a marker to view the address, owner name, and the other
        properties that person owns
      </p>
      <h3>How can I verify this information?</h3>
      <p>
        All of this information is publicly available and verifiable at
        <a href="https://www.denvergov.org/property/realproperty/"
          >https://www.denvergov.org/property/realproperty/</a
        >

      <h3>Things of Note</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Apartment buildings/condos are not included in this list. While the
          owners are technically landlords, the goal of this project was to see
          who is buying up all of the homes in Denver.
        </li>
        <li>
          Since this list is compiled by owner, there are owners that some
          people may not typically consider landlords. Owners like the "CITY &
          COUNTY OF DENVER" or "SCHOOL DISTRICT NO 1". I left those in the data
          set because I didn't want to accidentally remove one that sounds like
          it is a government entity when really it is a private entity.
