      <h1>What is this?</h1>
      <p>
        This is a map of every property that is owned by a landlord. I have
        defined a landlord as someone who owns more than 1 property or has LLC
        or Trust in the name of the owner. This map should help illustrate how
        much property in Denver is owned as "an investment".
      </p>
      <h3>How to use</h3>
      <p>

        properties that person owns
